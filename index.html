     <p>Today I just spent a little bit of time to configure some css styling on the nav buttons and made them change color on hover.

   <h2>2023-11-04 - The Beginning</h2>
   <p>This marks the beginning of my journey learning how to build a website from scratch. I've been wanting to create a website for years now but often got too caught up<br />
      in what theme to use or how to format things or where to host it, so I figured I'd stop worrying about all of that and just start. As I go I'll try to document new things I learn<br />
      and take periodic screenshots of my webpage so I can look back at where I started and see my progress. Eventually I hope to have a fully functional website that looks great and is something<br />
      I can be really proud of!
