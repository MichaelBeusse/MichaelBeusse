      <h2>Updating to a Blog Layout</h2>
      <h5>December 3rd, 2023</h5>
      <p>Today I switched over to a two column simple blog layout instead ofa grid layout. I decided to try two floating columns first while I learn more CSS formatting to make it easier. I also spent some time trying to reconfigure the links and turn them into buttons that look nicer. Next I'd like to learn about flex and spend some time trying to utilize flex boxes to organize content.</p>

      <p>Today I just spent a little bit of time to configure some css styling on the nav buttons and made them change color on hover. I also adjusted some of the css so it would look better in different browser sizes, using relative width values instead of absolute values.</p>

      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <h5>November 4th, 2023</h5>
      <p>This marks the beginning of my journey learning how to build a website from scratch. I've been wanting to create a website for years now but often got too caught up in what theme to use or how to format things or where to host it, so I figured I'd stop worrying about all of that and just start. As I go I'll try to document new things I learn and take periodic screenshots of my webpage so I canlook back at where I started and see my progress. Eventually I hope to have a fully functional website that looks great and is something I can be really proud of!</p>
