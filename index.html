    <p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="computer-small.jpg" alt="computer screen"><div style="vertical-align:middle; display:inline;">Today I just spent a little bit of time to configure some css styling on the nav buttons and made them change color on hover. I also adjusted some of the css so it would look better in different browser sizes, using relative width values instead of absolute values.</div></p>

     <h2>2023-11-04 - The Beginning</h2>
       <p>This marks the beginning of my journey learning how to build a website from scratch. I've been wanting to create a website for years now but often got too caught up in what theme to use or how to format things or where to host it, so I figured I'd stop worrying about all of that and just start. As I go I'll try to document new things I learn and take periodic screenshots of my webpage so I canlook back at where I started and see my progress. Eventually I hope to have a fully functional website that looks great and is something I can be really proud of!</p>
